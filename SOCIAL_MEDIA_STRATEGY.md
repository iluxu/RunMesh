## 📱 Platform Strategy

### Twitter/X (Primary Platform)

**Why**: Tech community, developer audience, viral potential

**Content Strategy**:

1. **Launch Thread** (Week 1)

   ```
   🚀 Introducing RunMesh - The Angular of Gen AI Applications

   After months of building, we're dropping the first truly batteries-included framework for AI agents.

   Here's why it's different 🧵👇

   [Thread continues with features, code samples, comparisons]
   ```

2. **Daily Code Tips** (Ongoing)
   - "RunMesh Tip of the Day"
   - Code snippets showing specific features
   - Before/After comparisons vs raw OpenAI SDK

3. **Show & Tell** (Weekly)
   - "Built with RunMesh" showcase
   - Community projects spotlight
   - Real-world use cases

4. **Engagement Hooks**:
   - "What AI agent would you build with RunMesh?"
   - Polls: "Which feature matters most?"
   - "Show me your coolest RunMesh agent" contests

**Example Tweets**:

```
🔥 Hot take: If you're still writing raw OpenAI API calls in 2025, you're doing it wrong.

RunMesh gives you:
✅ Type safety
✅ Multi-provider (200+ models)
✅ React hooks
✅ Tool validation
✅ Memory & streaming

It's what the ecosystem has been missing.

Building AI agents shouldn't feel like plumbing.

With RunMesh, this is all you need for a production-ready chatbot:

No boilerplate. No glue code. Just pure agent logic.

npm install @runmesh/agent
```

```
🎯 RunMesh: The Angular of Gen AI

Hi HN! I'm excited to share RunMesh, a comprehensive TypeScript framework
for building AI agents.

The Problem: Building AI agents today means writing tons of boilerplate,
juggling multiple SDKs, and dealing with poor type safety.

RunMesh Solution:
• Multi-provider support (200+ models via OpenRouter)
• End-to-end type safety with Zod
• React hooks for frontend
• CLI scaffolding (like create-next-app)
• Built-in testing, memory, streaming

It's inspired by Angular's "batteries included" philosophy but for AI.

I'd love your feedback!
